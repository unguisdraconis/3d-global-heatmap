# Data sources and methodology

Temperies presents derived weekly mean temperature fields for the historical year 2025. This document records the source products, processing choices, attribution, and interpretation limits for the checked-in dataset under `public/data/2025`.

## Copernicus ERA5 land-air field

- **Product:** [ERA5 post-processed daily statistics on single levels](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/datasets/derived-era5-single-levels-daily-statistics)
- **Dataset DOI:** [10.24381/cds.4991cf48](https://doi.org/10.24381/cds.4991cf48)
- **Variable:** 2 m temperature
- **Request:** daily mean, 1-hourly sampling, UTC+00:00, reanalysis product type
- **Coverage used:** January 1–December 31, 2025
- **Role in Temperies:** air temperature for cells outside the invariant OISST ocean support footprint
- **Licence:** the Climate Data Store catalogue identifies this product under a CC BY licence. Users should consult the current catalogue entry and attribution guidance before redistributing source or derived data.

The CDS daily-statistics service calculates the daily aggregation during retrieval. Temperies combines those daily means into its displayed periods and bilinearly samples the source grid onto the canonical 0.25° cell centers with periodic longitude handling.

## NOAA OISST ocean field

- **Product:** [NOAA 0.25° Daily Optimum Interpolation Sea Surface Temperature, Version 2.1](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/optimum-interpolation-sst)
- **Dataset DOI:** [10.25921/RE9P-PT57](https://doi.org/10.25921/RE9P-PT57)
- **Variable:** sea-surface temperature
- **Coverage used:** January 1–December 31, 2025
- **Role in Temperies:** sea-surface temperature and the invariant ocean support footprint

OISST is a gridded analysis combining bias-adjusted satellite and in-situ inputs, with spatial interpolation used to produce a completed field. Temperies reorders its native 0.25° cell centers without spatial resampling. The pipeline rejects a daily file if its valid-data footprint differs from the reference footprint.

## Borders and coastlines

Temperies obtains 1:110m country and land topology from the [`world-atlas`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/world-atlas) package, derived from [Natural Earth](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/). Natural Earth states that its raster and vector map data are in the public domain. The overlay is visual context only and does not determine whether a climate cell uses ERA5 or OISST.

## Temporal aggregation

The year is divided into 52 consecutive periods:

- Weeks 1–51 contain seven daily fields.
- The final period, December 24–31, contains eight daily fields so all 365 days are represented exactly once.
- There are no temporal gaps or overlaps.

The LOW and HIGH controls identify spatial extrema in the selected period's weekly mean field. They are not instantaneous observed weather records.

## Spatial grid and projection

- Grid: 1440 columns × 720 rows
- Resolution: 0.25° × 0.25°
- Cell centers: 89.875°N to 89.875°S and 179.875°W to 179.875°E
- Row order: north to south
- Column order: west to east
- Raster layout: equirectangular, or regular latitude–longitude/Plate Carrée
- Display: the fragment shader derives longitude and latitude from the 3D sphere and samples the corresponding raster cell

Equal angular cells do not have equal physical area. Histogram populations and displayed-surface percentages therefore use cosine-of-latitude area weighting.

## Composite interpretation

The Composite layer places two different physical variables into one geographic view:

- ERA5 2 m air temperature over the air-routed surface;
- OISST sea-surface temperature over supported ocean cells.

It is useful for visual exploration, but it is not a single homogeneous measurement product. Temperies does not present these values as direct point observations, temperature anomalies, climate normals, forecasts, or evidence of attribution.

## Processing and reproducibility

The acquisition and processing scripts are under `scripts/real_data`. The complete workflow is documented in [`docs/real-data-pipeline.md`](docs/real-data-pipeline.md). Original NetCDF downloads and full local validation artifacts are intentionally excluded because of their size. A compact checked-in record of coverage, counts, and checksums is available in [`docs/data-provenance-2025.md`](docs/data-provenance-2025.md).

The source products and their terms remain authoritative. This document records the project's use of those products; it is not legal advice and does not replace their licences, use agreements, or citation guidance.
